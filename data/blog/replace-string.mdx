## Learn how to use JavaScript to replace all white space.

Replacing all of the white space within a string is a relatively typical requirement.

For example, I most recently utilized this within a documentation route in one of our projects. I was generating a helper page for our clients for reference and it was a great experience.

The requirement was simple, we used the **strapi** and **RearctMarkdown** to parse the **md** file, the feature we wanted was to add a table of contents at the right of this page section for easing navigation, we simply parse all the **H** tags and extracted the id from it but the id contained a white space, we must replace

So I looked into the best strategy to accomplish my goal. One of the strategies listed below can assist you in this regard.

Here it is, in full

### 1. Using Regx

```js
const name = 'No One Is The Same'
const replacedName = name.replace(/\s/g, '') //NoOneIsTheSame
```

<Note type="tip">
#### üìå Tips

The **\s meta character** in JavaScript regular expressions matches any whitespace character: **spaces**, **tabs**, **newlines** and **Unicode spaces**.

And the **g flag** tells JavaScript to **replace it multiple times**. If you miss it, it will only replace the **first occurrence** of the white space.

</Note>

### 2. Using replaceAll() method

The **replaceAll()** function is actually a **JavaScript builtin method**. This method generally accepts **two parameters**: the value that will be replaced and the value that will be used as a replacer.

It is especially used when **all** of the supplied values must be replaced at once.

```js
const name = 'Everything Is Replaceable'
const replacedName = name.replaceAll(' ', '-') // Everything-Is-Replaceable
```

### 3. Using spit and join

```js
const name = 'Your All Has Something Good'
const replacedName = name.split(' ').join('-') // Your-All-Has-Something-Good
```
