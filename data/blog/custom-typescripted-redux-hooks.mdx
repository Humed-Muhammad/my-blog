## What is redux?

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing and centralizing application state. Redux helps you write applications that are Predictable, Centralized, Debuggable, and Flexible behavior.

## Introduction

React Redux offers a set of hooks as an alternative to the existing connect() higher-order component. These hooks allow you to connect to the Redux store and dispatch actions without having to wrap your components in connect().

For example the **useDispatch** and **useSelector** hooks helps you to subscribe to the Redux store and dispatch actions.

This guide will cover how to implement and customize the **React-Redux** hooks **useSelector** and **useDispatch** for type support in your typescript application.

## Why we need to create a typed redux hooks anyway?

While it's possible to import the RootState and AppDispatch types into each component, it's better to create pre-typed versions of the useDispatch and useSelector hooks for usage in your application. This is important for a couple reasons:

- For **useSelector**, it saves you the need to type **(state: RootState)** every time.

- For **useDispatch**, the default **Dispatch** type does not know about **thunks** or **other middleware**. In order to **correctly** dispatch thunks, you need to use the specific customized AppDispatch type from the store that includes the thunk middleware types, and use that with **useDispatch**. Adding **a pre-typed** useDispatch hook keeps you from forgetting to **import AppDispatch** where it's needed.

- Ok without further ado let get started!.

#### 1. Project setup.

- You can use the create-react-app boilerplate to create your react app or any other boilerplate generators for react.

```js
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
cd my-app
```

#### 2. Intalling redux for your react application.

- Let us install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
npm i redux react-redux
```

#### 3. Configuring your redux store.

- In your src directory create a file called store and an store.ts
- Also create a file for your reducers

```tsx
// src/store/store.ts
// src/store/reducers.ts

import { createStore } from 'redux'
import { reducers } from './reducers'
let store = createStore(reducers)
export store
```

<Note>
  **Note:** The above example uses the traditional way of creating a redux store, if you want to see

  this](how-to-setup-your-redux-store-using-redux-toolkit)
</Note>
#### 4. Creating types.

- create a file in utils called types.ts

```tsx // src/utils/types.ts
import { store } from '../store/store'

export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch
```

#### 5. Creating redux hooks flavored by typescript.

- Create a file called reduxhooks.ts

```tsx
// src/utils/reduxhooks.ts

import { TypedUseSelectorHook, useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'
import type { AppDispatch, RootState } from './types'

export const useAppDispatch = () => useDispatch<AppDispatch>()
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector
```

## Conclusion

Finally, we've arrived; now you can go home and do whatever you want with your life; I'm finished with this article. I will not leave without thanking you for allowing me to still your time.

**Happy coding ðŸŽ‰**
