## Introduction

Ports are virtual places within an operating system where network connections start and end. They help computers sort the network traffic they receive. This means they are entities in a computer networking which acts as a communication endpoint for identifying a given process or application on the a given operating system.

## How to close open ports in linux

- There are several ways to close open ports in linux.

1. ## Using fuser

```js
fuser -k 3001/tcp
```

<Note>**-k** -> for kill</Note>

2. ## Using lsof

```bash
sudo kill $(sudo lsof -t -i:5000)
```

- In place of 5000 you can specify your port number

<Note>
  **-t :** This flag specifies that lsof should produce terse output with process identifiers only
  and no header - e.g., so that the output may be piped to kill(1). This option selects the -w
  option.
</Note>

<Note>
  **-i :** This flag selects the listing of files any of whose Internet address matches the address
  specified in i. If no address is specified, this option selects the listing of all Internet and
  x.25 (HP-UX) network files.
</Note>
