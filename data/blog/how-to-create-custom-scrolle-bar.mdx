## Introduction

### What is a scrollbar?

A scroll bar's sole purpose is to allow the user to generate scrolling requests in order to view the entire content of the client area.

## How to create a custom scrollbar in css

- There are different ways to create a custom scrollbar and it depends on the browsers compatibility.

- Let's take a look at the two methods for creating a custom scrollbar.

1. ## Using the ::webkit pseudo selector

- The ::-webkit-scrollbar CSS pseudo-element affects the style of an element's scrollbar when it has overflow:scroll; set.

```css
.container,
.containertwo,
 {
  display: block;
  width: 10em;
  overflow: auto;
  height: 2em;
}

/**Hide the scrollbar */
.containertwo::-webkit-scrollbar {
  display: none;
}

/*
 * (won't be visible if width/height is not specified) */
.container::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 5px;
  height: 8px;
  background-color: #aaa; /* or add it to the track */
}

/* Add a thumb */
.mostly-customized-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background: #000;

```

<Note type="warning">
  **Non-standard:** This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on
  production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large
  incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.
</Note>

<Note>
  **Note:** If overflow:scroll; is not set, no scrollbar is displayed. **::-webkit-scrollbar** is
  only available in Blink- and WebKit-based browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Opera, Safari, all
  browsers on iOS, and others).
</Note>

2. ## Using the standard scrollbar

- CSS Scrollbars standardizes the obsolete scrollbar color properties introduced in 2000 by Windows IE 5.5.

```css
.container {
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  overflow-y: scroll;
  scrollbar-color: rebeccapurple green;
  scrollbar-width: thin;
}
```

<Note>
  Experimental: This is an experimental technology Check the [Browser
  compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scrollbars#browser_compatibility)
  carefully before using this in production.
</Note>

## My experiance

I wouldn't let you go after making such a buzz in your choices; instead, I'd like to share my own experience with using customized scrollbars, how it ended up for me, and whether or not I used it in production.

Yes, I used it in production; which one?

I used the ::-webkit-scrollbar pseudo selector, which worked flawlessly in almost all browsers.

## Conclusion

Thank you for sticking with me this far even if the article was very short üòÅ, I hope this was helpful.

Happy coding üéâ!
