## Introduction

### What is a ui library

In its most basic form, a UI library is a collection of materials, or components, that you can easily use or modify to meet your needs. Consider UI components to be single elements available in that library, such as buttons, input fields, or banners made of pure HTML, CSS, and, in some cases, Javascript.

- Without further ado, let us take a look at the UI library we have for today

## List

## 1. [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev)

<ImageComponent
  className="my-4"
  src="/static/images/mantine.png"
  width="100%"
  height="100%"
  alt="Mantine UI"
/>

- A fully featured react component library, Build fully functional
  accessible web applications faster than ever. Mantine includes **more than 100** customizable components
  and 40 hooks to cover you in any situation.

## 2. [Ant Design](https://ant.design)

## 3. [Material UI](https://mui.com)

- MUI provides a comprehensive set of UI tools to help you ship new features more quickly. Begin with Material UI, our comprehensive component library, or bring your own design system to our production-ready components.

## 4. [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com)

<ImageComponent
  className="my-4"
  src="/static/images/chakra.png"
  width="100%"
  height="100%"
  alt="chakra ui"
/>

- Create accessible React apps with **speed**, it uses @rmaotion under the hood to give you a flexibility that you will not have in other components libraries.

- Chakra UI is a simple, modular, and approachable component library that provides the building blocks for your React applications.

## 5. [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com)

<ImageComponent
  className="my-4"
  src="/static/images/tailwind.png"
  width="100%"
  height="100%"
  alt="tailwind ui"
/>

- Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.

- A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

## 6. [Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com)

<ImageComponent
  className="my-4"
  src="/static/images/blueprint.png"
  width="100%"
  height="100%"
  alt="blueprint design system"
/>

- Blueprint is an open source project
  developed at Palantir.

- It is optimized for building complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications.

- My first encounter with this ui component library was yesterday, the day before I wrote this blog post, and I was blown away by their decoupling of each component into its own package that you can install separately and include in your project.

## 7. [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com)

<ImageComponent
  className="my-4"
  src="/static/images/semantic.png"
  width="100%"
  height="100%"
  alt="semantic design system"
/>

- jQuery Free
- It is not feasible to keep real DOM manipulations in sync with React's virtual DOM. Because of this, all jQuery functionality has been re-implemented in React.

- Semantic UI is a front-end development framework for theming that is similar to Bootstrap. It includes pre-built semantic components for creating beautiful and responsive layouts with human-friendly HTML.

## 8. [Headless ui](https://headlessui.com)

<ImageComponent
  className="my-4"
  src="/static/images/headless.png"
  width="100%"
  height="100%"
  alt="headless design system"
/>

- Completely unstyled, fully accessible UI components, designed to integrate beautifully with Tailwind CSS.

- Headless UI is a very simple UI component with fewer components than the other libraries, but the components are notable for their beauty and simplicity.
