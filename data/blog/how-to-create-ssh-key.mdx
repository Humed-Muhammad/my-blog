## Introduction
### What is SSH

**SSH** or **Secure Shell** is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate.

For example you can access remote server, respositories service providers or even your remote local machine if it is live :), and many more things.

- Today we are going to see how to create ssh key on ubuntu

## Generating a new SSH key

You can generate a new SSH key on your local machine, then after you generated the key, for example you can add the key to your account on **GitHub** to enable authentication for Git operations over SSH.

1. Open Terminal (ctrl + alt + t)
2. Type the following to create a new ssh key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
`Note`: change to your own email,

`Note`: If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:
 `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`


This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label.

3. When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

4. At the prompt, type a secure `passphrase` of you own (it is like password, make sure you remember it, we are going to need it later):

## Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent

1. Starting the ssh-agent in the background.
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```
Output:
```js
Agent pid 59566
```

2. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent.
```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
- The above command will prompt you to enter the passphrase, type it and hit enter.
