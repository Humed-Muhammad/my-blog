Backlinks—also known as inbound links or external links—refer to links on one website pointing to another website.

Search engines, like Google or Bing, view backlinks as indicators of quality content that has the support of other websites. Pages with more backlinks can rank higher on SERPs (search engine results pages).

## The Importance of Backlinks in Your SEO Strategy

Do backlinks have a big impact on your SEO?

Absolutely.

Backlinks are a critical component of SEO. Earning authoritative backlinks is one of the most important signals that Google considers for ranking content.

We may never know exactly what Google’s ranking factors are, but here are a few recommended-best practices.
But what makes a high-quality backlink?

Trust is a huge factor. If a quality website with an excellent reputation links to your site, that's a fantastic vote of confidence.

If you only have sites that Google considers spammy linking to your website, it's not likely to help you much.

Popularity is another consideration. Because Google views external links as votes of popularity for a website or webpage, there is a strong correlation between sites with lots of (quality) backlinks and higher rankings.
