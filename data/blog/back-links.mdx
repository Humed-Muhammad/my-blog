## Introduction

### What are backlinks

Backlinks, sometimes referred to as inbound links or external links, are hyperlinks that lead from one website to another.

Backlinks are considered evidence of high-quality content that has the backing of other websites by search engines like Google or Bing. On SERPs, pages with more backlinks can appear higher (search engine results pages).

### The Importance of Backlinks in Your SEO Strategy

Do backlinks have a big impact on your SEO?

Absolutely.

Backlinks are an important part of SEO. One of the most significant factors that Google takes into account when ranking content is the acquisition of authoritative backlinks.

What constitutes a high-quality backlink?

Trust is a key component. It's a terrific vote of confidence when a reputable, high-quality website links to yours.

It's unlikely to be very helpful if all the websites connecting to your website are ones that Google considers spammy.

Popularity is another another factor. There is a significant association between websites with many (quality) backlinks and higher ranks since Google considers external links to be votes of popularity for a website or webpage.

## On-Page vs. Off-Page Optimization

Let's clarify the function of backlinks in search engine optimization now that we are aware of what they are.

### On-page SEO

Everything you do to your web pages to "make them search engine friendly".

### Off-page optimization

Backlinks play a significant role in off-page optimization, which encompasses everything that takes on around your brand but outside of your website (because they point back to your site).

## Some facts of SEO

According to study after study, the top spots in Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) are the most-linked-to websites on that specific topic.

What does this mean? It makes no difference if you have the best content or the best on-page optimization strategy if your link profile stinks.

Why? If you write content that is similar to your competition's, there is no guarantee that you will beat them unless you understand both sides of SEO. Simply put, you must generate more links than they do.

So, while you must still understand on-page optimization, you must not overlook linking. It may surprise you to learn that good SEO requires you to devote as much time to your backlinking strategy as you do to developing your content.

## Types of Backlinks

First and foremost, how do you obtain backlinks? There are several ways to score them, and many more ways not to. Let's start with the most legitimate methods of attracting links to your website:

#### 1. Editorial links

#### 2. Manual links

#### 3. Self-created links/ Random links from around the web

## Editorial links

These are the most valuable types of links you can obtain, and they have the potential to propel your site to the top of the SERPs. These are from reputable sites with high traffic volumes, such as CNN or the Washington Post.

Sites or pages that link to your content, pages, and products will naturally provide editorial links. To obtain these links, you must have high-quality content on your website and connect with contributors on other websites to raise awareness about it.

## Manual links

This type of link building is also known as outreach building. To obtain manual links, you must first build relationships with bloggers and editors and then request that they link to your pages or products.

Negotiation is required for successful link outreach. You must make a compelling case for why creating a backlink for you is in their best interests.

## Self-created links/ Random links from around the web

This broad category of links includes everything from Wiki Links to directory links, user profiles, forum signatures, video links, and anything else you come across. Users simply submit their site to be displayed publicly.

These low-value links demonstrate that the easier it is to obtain a backlink, the lower its likely value. If you have too many of these, your site will appear'spammy.' Low-quality SEO services frequently exaggerate their significance.
