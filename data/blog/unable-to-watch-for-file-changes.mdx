## Introduction

The visual studio code unable to watch for file changes issue occurs when vscode is unable to watch the file beyond its watch limit; to resolve this issue, simply increase the limit slightly.

<GoogleHorizontalAdUnit path="vscode unable to watch file changes" />

## Solution

#### 1. Check the current limit

```bash
cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
```

#### 2. Open sysctl.conf file

```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```

#### 3. Add this line at bottom

```bash
fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
```

#### 4. Save and exit

- Ctrl + x then Ctrl + c

#### 5. Reload the change

```bash
sudo sysctl -p
```

#### 6. Check the limit again

```bash
cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
```

- If the count is same, execute the following command:

```bash
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

ðŸŽ‰ Happy coding.
