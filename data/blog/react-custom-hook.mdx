## Introduction

In React 16.8++, hooks are a brand-new feature. They provide state and other React capabilities without the need for class creation.

You can convert component logic into reusable functions by creating your own Hooks. They promote reuseability and allow you the freedom to utilize your logic more effectively.

## Example 1

Without further ado, let's get started.

### Consider this scenario: we want to create a custom hook that formats the meony based on the currency type.

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
const useCurrency = (value, currencyType = 'USD') => {
  const [currency, setCurrency] = useState('')
  useEffect(() => {
    const formatter = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
      style: 'currency',
      currencyType,
    })
    if (value) {
      setCurrency(formatter.format(value))
    }
  }, [value, currencyType])

  return currency
}
```

### Inside your component

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { useCurrency } from './customHooks'

export const Component = (props) => {
  // The second parameter is optional as we did in the above code block.
  const { currency } = useCurrency(props.price)
  const { currency: curr } = useCurrency(props.price, 'EUR')

  return (
    <>
      {currency} //USD
      {curr} //EUR
    </>
  )
}
```

## Example 2

#### If we want to calculate the width of the window's value whenever its width changes,

```tsx
export const useWindowWidth = () => {
  const [windowWidth, setWindowWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth)
  const handleWindowWidth = useCallback(() => {
    setWindowWidth(window.innerWidth)
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleWindowWidth)
  }, [handleWindowWidth])

  return { width: windowWidth }
}
```

## Conclusion

Custom Hooks provide you the flexibility to share logic in a way that was previously impossible with React components. Form handling, animation, declarative subscriptions, timers, and possibly many other use cases we haven't thought of are just a few of the numerous use cases that can be covered by custom Hooks. Additionally, you are able to create Hooks that are just as user-friendly as React's built-in functionality.
