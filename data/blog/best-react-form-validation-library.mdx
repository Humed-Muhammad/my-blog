## Introduction

## What is form validation?

Form validation is a technical process where a web-form checks if the information provided by a user is correct.

## React form validation

Form validation in react has never been easy, but thanks to the open source community, there are numerous libraries available to help you get started quickly.

Whenever I talk about the form validation in react, I always remember to take in to consideration the state managment of the libraries used under the hood to manage the form state.

- Let's look at the list of libraries available for react form validation.

1. ## [Formik](https://formik.org/)

- [Github](https://github.com/formik/formik)
- Slogan: "Build forms in React, without the tears"
- Support for React Native

Formik is the world's most popular open source form library for React and React Native. Formik handles the tedious and inconvenient tasks, such as keeping track of values/errors/visited fields, orchestrating validation, and handling submission, so you don't have to. This means you'll spend less time configuring state and change handlers and more time focusing on business logic.

2. ## [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)

- [Github](https://github.com/bluebill1049/react-hook-form)
- Slogan: Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.
- Support for React Native

React Hook Form reduces the amount of code you need to write while removing unnecessary re-renders. It also allows you to isolate component re-renders, which leads to better page or app performance.

- To be honest, this library is becoming my favorite.
- With over 30k+ github stars, it stands out from the crowd.

3. ## [react-final-form](https://final-form.org/react/)

- [Github](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form)
- Slogan: High performance subscription-based form state management for React

React Final Form is a lightweight wrapper for the no-dependency Final Form core. All React Final Form knows is how to get form values from SyntheticEvent and manage form field subscriptions. You won't need to fine-tune your form's performance very often, but if your form grows and begins to lag, you'll be glad you chose React Final Form. In React, any form or field state can be used to trigger a rerender.

#### This is the end. I will not confuse you with a longer list because these three are the beast's in the town.

## My experiance

I worked with the first two form validation libraries, and I really like how Formik handles the form state from collecting input to displaying errors, and I really enjoyed working with it. I also used react-hook-form, and the performance was fantastic, greatly improving my website.

As I previously stated, if I have large forms that can slow down the performance of my website, react-hook-form is vying to become my favorite.

- Both themes are great and have their own way of handling things; I strongly advise you to try both and decide which one you should use for production.
