## Introduction

This article will walk you through the steps of integrating Google Analytics into your Next.js application and using the data to improve user experience.

### Why Do You Need Google Analytics?

Google Analytics is a free service that collects data on users' interactions with your website. It provides insights on how people find your site, what they do when they get there and what they click on.

Google Analytics is one of the most popular analytics tools in the world. It is used by more than 175 million websites and has over 2 million active users.

The tool provides insights into how people use your website. It can help you understand their behaviour, which pages they are looking at, which links have been clicked and where they come from. You can also see which devices are being used to access your website, what operating system the visitors have and their location to name a few things that it tracks.

### Why nextjs?

Next.js is an open-source framework for building web applications with JavaScript. It aims to be a minimalistic framework that makes it easy to create universal web applications that work well on both client and server side.

### Installing next.js

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
# or
yarn create next-app
# or
pnpm create next-app

```

If you want to start with a TypeScript project you can use the --typescript flag:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
# or
yarn create next-app --typescript
# or
pnpm create next-app --typescript

```

### Setting up Google Tag Manager with Next.js application

#### 1. Create an Analytics component

```jsx
// Analytics.jsx

import Script from 'next/script'

import siteMetadata from '@/data/siteMetadata'

export const GAScript = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Script strategy="lazyOnload" src={'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXX'} />

      <Script strategy="lazyOnload" id="ga-script">
        {`
            window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
            function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
            gtag('js', new Date());
            gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXX', {
              page_path: window.location.pathname,
            });
        `}
      </Script>
    </>
  )
}

// https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/events
export const logEvent = (action, category, label, value) => {
  window.gtag?.('event', action, {
    event_category: category,
    event_label: label,
    value: value,
  })
}
```

Open your \_app.js/ts file add the following at the top of your component.

```tsx
import {Analytics} from "your component path"
...
<>
    <Analytics />
    <LayoutWrapper>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </LayoutWrapper>
</>
...
```

<Note>

Make sure to replace G-XXXXXXX withyour Mesurment ID

</Note>

### Additional step

If you used next.config.js file for configurations then make sure to add the google tag manager link to the Allowed ContentSecurityPolicy at the **script-src** like bellow:

```js

script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' googletagmanager.com/gtag/js

```

<Note type="warning">Also make sure your site is approved on adsense.</Note>
