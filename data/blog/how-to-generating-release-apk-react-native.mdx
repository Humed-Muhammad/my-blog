## Utilizing the React Native CLI

First and foremost, ensure that your Android project is error-free. That implies it is successfully building and running on the emulator or an Android device. As a result, either launch the Android project in Android Studio or run it from the command line. If everything builds correctly, you're good to go.

## Generate a release build apk

1. ### Open your project directory in cmd

```bash
ctrl + alt + t
cd my-app directory
```

2. ### cd to android folder

```bash
cd android
```

3. ### Assemble the release

- For Windows

```bash
gradlew assembleRelease
```

- For Linux / Mac

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

These are steps to generate a Release Signed APK in React Native for Android applications without the keystore.

## Errors

**Note:** If you face any error, please take a look at the error message. Some of them are listed below and how to fix them.

1. ### The :app:processReleaseResources FAILED

- Copy the following commands and paste it to your terminal and press enter.

- The **cd ..** will take you to the root of the project from the android folder if you are alreasy inside the android folder. if not don't use the **cd ..** part.

```bash
cd ..
rm -rf android/app/src/main/res/drawable-*
npx react-native bundle --platform android --dev false \
  --entry-file index.js \
  --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle \
  --assets-dest android/app/build/intermediates/res/merged/release/
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

2. ### The Kotlin session error

- Occures Maybe due to multiple versions of kotlin being used on build time.

- To fix this problem you have to set a Kotlin version on your project level build grade **android/build.gradle**.
  for example:

```js
buildscript {
    ext {
        // ...
        kotlin_version = '1.6.10' // <- add this line
    }

    dependencies {
        // ...
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version" // <- add this line
        // ...
    }
}
```

3. ### The error: failed linking references.

- **Example**: react-native-document-picker:verifyReleaseResources FAILED

- Some times it is you packges that work in debug mode may stop working during the build time for release.

- The following will fix it

```bash
cd android
./gradlew app:assembleRelease
```
