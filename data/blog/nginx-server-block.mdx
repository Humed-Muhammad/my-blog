## Overview

## Introduction

### What is nginx server blocks

Nginx Server Blocks allow you to run multiple websites on a single machine. You can specify the site document root (the directory containing the website files) with Server Blocks, create a separate security policy for each site, use different SSL certificates for each site, and much more.

<Note>
  `Note:` Nginx server blocks are similar to virtual hosts in Apache.

    If you `don't` have nginx installed you can use [this](how-to-install-nginx) resource to do
    that.
  </div>
</Note>

**Nginx** has one server block enabled by default, which is configured to serve documents from the **/var/www/html** directory. While this is fine for a single site, it can become cumbersome if you host multiple sites.

## Creating the file to serve

- Rather than modifying the **/var/www/html** directory, we will create a new file in the /var/ directory, such as **/var/your domain/html**.

- Create the new file:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/your_own_domain/html
```

<Note>`Note:` **-p** falg let you create nested directories</Note>

- Assign ownership with $USER variable:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/your_own_domain/html
```

- To make sure ower permmisions are correctly set run the following command:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/your_domain
```

<Note>`Note:` **chmod -R 755** allow the user to read and write.</Note>

- For test create simple html file:

```bash
sudo nano /var/www/your_domain/html/index.html
```

- Copy the following to it:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Welcome!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Grea! The your_own_domain server block is up and running!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

- Click **ctrl + s** then **ctrl + x** to save and exit the editor:

## Creating the server block

- In order to server this file we must first create a server block and connect to it:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_own_domain
```

-- Then copy the following to it:

```js
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        root /var/www/your_own_domain/html;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name your_own_domain www.your_own_domain;

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}
```

**We've changed the root configuration to point to our new directory and the server name to our domain name.**

## Linking to nginx site_enabled

- Next, let's make a link from it to the sites-enabled directory, which Nginx reads when it boots up:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_own_domain /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

<Note>
  **Note:** Nginx uses symbolic links, or symlinks, to keep track of which server blocks are active.
  Making a symlink is similar to making a disk shortcut.
</Note>

## Finalizing

<Note type="error">
  **Note:** for avoiding hash bucket memory problem that may arise from adding additional server
  blocks, we should adjust the hash bucket size in nginx.conf file
</Note>

- To do that:

```bash
 sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

- Then find the server_names_hash_bucket_size
  directive and remove the **#** symbol to uncomment the line, save and close the file.

- Restart Nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

- Vist by following **http://your_own_domain**

## Conclusion

You now understand how to manage the Nginx service as well as how to manage and serve server blocks. Thank you for sticking with me this far; I'll see you later.
