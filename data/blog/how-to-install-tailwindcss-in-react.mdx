## Introduction

Tailwind css is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

[For plain html and js projects follow this](install-tailwindcss)

## Setting up Tailwind CSS in a Create React App project.

The tailwind team highly recommend using Vite, Next.js, Remix, or Parcel instead `create-react-app`, because they provide an equivalent or better developer experience.

1. Create your project

- If you don't already have one, start by creating a new React project with Create React App.

  <Note>**Note:** make sure to use v5.0+ for create-react-app</Note>

```bash
npx create-react-app my-project
cd my-project
```

2. Install Tailwind CSS

- Install tailwindcss and its dependencies using npm, then run the init command to generate tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js.

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

3. Configure your template paths

- Add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.js file.

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

4. Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS (e.g. in index.css)

- Add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwindâ€™s layers to your ./src/index.css file.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

5. Start the Tailwind build process

```bash
npm start
```

6. Start using Tailwind

Start using Tailwind's utility classes to style your content.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">Hello world!</h1>
}
```

- This is how to get started and install tailwindcss in a react projects, if you want to know how to install tailwindcss in a plain html and js project follow [this](install-tailwindcss)
