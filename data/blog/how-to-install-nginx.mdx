## Overview

## Introduction

Nginx is one of the most popular web servers in the world, hosting some of the largest and busiest websites on the internet. It is a lightweight option that can function as both a web server and a reverse proxy.

This guide will walk you through installing Nginx on your Ubuntu server or desktop version, configuring the firewall, and managing the Nginx process.

## Installing Nginx

Nginx is available in Ubuntu's default repositories, so it can be installed from there using the apt packaging system.

Because this is our first interaction with the apt packaging system in this session, we'll update our local package index to get the most up-to-date package listings. Following that, we can install nginx:

- First upadte your repositories to avoid conflicts

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Thene run the following command to install nginx

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

## Configuring the firewall

Prior to testing Nginx, the firewall software must be configured to allow access to the service. Upon installation, Nginx registers itself as a service with ufw, making it simple to grant Nginx access.

The following command will list configurations that ufw is familiar with:

```bash
sudo ufw app list
```

You will get list of the following

```js
Output
Available applications:
  Nginx Full
  Nginx HTTP
  Nginx HTTPS
  OpenSSH
```

As the output shows, there are three Nginx profiles available:

- Nginx Full: This profile opens both port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic) and port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic)

- Nginx HTTP: This profile only allows access to port 80. (normal, unencrypted web traffic)

- Nginx HTTPS: This profile only allows access to port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic).

It is recommended that you select the most secure option, but for the time being, we will allow traffic on port 80.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
```

verify it by running the following command:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

- Output:

```js
Output
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
Nginx HTTP                 ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
Nginx HTTP (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

## Check nginx is running

Ubuntu starts Nginx at the end of the installation process. The web server should already be operational.

We can check the service's status with the systemd init system by typing:

```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

- Output:

```js
Output
● nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Fri 2020-04-20 16:08:19 UTC; 3 days ago
     Docs: man:nginx(8)
 Main PID: 2369 (nginx)
    Tasks: 2 (limit: 1153)
   Memory: 3.5M
   CGroup: /system.slice/nginx.service
           ├─2369 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on;
           └─2380 nginx: worker process
```

## Controlling the Nginx Process

Let's go over some basic management commands now that you've successfully installed nginx and your web server is up and running.

- Stop your web server, type:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx
```

- Start the web server when it is stopped, type:

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

- To restart the web server, type:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

- If you only make configuration changes, Nginx will frequently reload without losing connections. To do so, type:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

- To disable nginx, type:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable nginx
```

-To enable nginx, type:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```
